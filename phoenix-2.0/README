## Phoenix Project


Phoenix is a shared-memory implementation of Google's MapReduce model
for data-intensive processing tasks. Phoenix can be used to program
multi-core chips as well as shared-memory multiprocessors (SMPs and
ccNUMAs).  Phoenix was developed as a class project for the EE382a
class at Stanford (Advanced Processor Architecture). The paper on
Phoenix won the best paper award in the HPCA'07 conference. 


## Phoenix 2.0

Phoenix 2 is the significantly improved version of the original Phoenix release.
Changes include:

- Linux (x86_64) support
- Enhanced NUMA support for Solaris environment
- Improved performance and stability

For more details please refer to the CHANGES file in this directory.

## What is Provided
-------------------

The Phoenix distribution includes the following directories:

docs:       The HPCA'07 paper and slides on Phoenix as well as the
            original OSDI'04 MapReduce paper by Google. 

src:        The source code for the Phoenix MapReduce library.

tests:      The source code for the sample MapReduce applications.
            For each application, we provide MapReduce, sequential, and 
            Pthreads code for comparison purposes. 

bin:        Supporting utilities.

include:    Header files for the Phoenix library.

lib:        Compiled Phoenix library.
 
Note: Three sample applications (i.e., kmeans, pca, and matrix_multiply)
      use randomly generated input data. For other workloads, additional input 
      datasets are necessary. This source code tar file does not include 
      these datasets. Please visit the Phoenix webpage to download additional 
      datasets.
