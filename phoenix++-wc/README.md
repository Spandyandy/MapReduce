## Phoenix++ ##

Phoenix++ is a C++ reimplementation of Phoenix 2.

Phoenix is a shared-memory implementation of Google's MapReduce model
for data-intensive processing tasks. Phoenix can be used to program
multi-core chips as well as shared-memory multiprocessors (SMPs and
ccNUMAs). Phoenix was developed as a class project for the EE382a
class at Stanford (Advanced Processor Architecture).
